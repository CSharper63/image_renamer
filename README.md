# Rename your images by their creation date

This small Rust program renames automatically all the images contained in ```<img_dir_path>``` by their creation date.
This is useful if like me you back up and sort by date your pictures after holidays.

Usage:
```bash
cargo run --release <img_dir_path>
```
